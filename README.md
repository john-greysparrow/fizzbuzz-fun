### Fizz Buzz Fun - Coding Example

###### Example 1: Standard

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz"
instead of the number and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples 
of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

To run, invoke the "FizzBuzzCmd" with arguments: -max 100

###### Example 2: Extended

- A number is Fizz if it is divisible by 3 or if it has a 3 in it
- A number is Buzz if it is divisible by 5 or if it has a 5 in it
- A number is FizzBuzz if it satisfies the above 2 criteria together

To run, invoke the "FizzBuzzCmd" with arguments: -max 100 -extended
